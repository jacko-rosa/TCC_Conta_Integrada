## Application description

This application is the mainly part of the final course project (TCC) at PUCRS.<br>
This application aims to consolidate information about financial accounts, primarily credit accounts, by summing up the value limits and exposing them as a single value. For example, if you have three accounts, one with a credit limit of R$1000.00, another with R$2000.00, and another with R$500.00, in the <span style="color:rebeccapurple; font-weight: bold">Conta Integrada</span> you will see R$3500.00.<br>
This project aims to make it easier to manage financial accounts, especially credit accounts.
